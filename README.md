# Group-K-Fold-Cross-Validation-vs-K-Fold-Cross-Validation

This is a personal study repository, all the code is written in Python 3 and hosted on Jupyter Notebook.

In this repository I am comparing the "Group K-Fold" and the "K-Fold" Cross Validation acuuracy results manually and using Sklearn library, for a binary classification problem.

The trained Supervised Machine Learning models:

## *1. AdaBoost Classifier
## *2. Random Forest Classifier
## *3. Decision Trees Classifier
## *4. Logistic Regression

In the next notebook I will be finetuning these models to improve the accuracy results.

I am open to suggestions, opinions and projects. :)
